# Cohere Chat App
This is a SwiftUI-based chat application that uses Cohere’s API to send and receive messages. The app features a chat interface where users can input text, which is then sent to the API. The response from the API is displayed in the chat, and both user and AI messages are saved in a local database using SwiftData. This project is designed to showcase skills in Swift, SwiftUI, and interaction with a third-party API.

## Features
- Chat Interface: A simple user interface to send and receive messages.
-	Real-time Response: Messages are sent to Cohere’s API and responses are displayed in real-time.
-	Message History: All user and AI messages are saved locally in a database using SwiftData.

## Technologies Used
- SwiftUI: Framework for building the user interface.
-	Alamofire: Networking library for making API calls.
-	Cohere API: Used for natural language processing and generating AI responses.
-	SwiftData: Local database framework for storing chat messages.
